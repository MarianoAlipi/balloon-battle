Enemies start with a pink balloon. If it's popped and they reach the ground, they will inflate a green 
one. If done again, a yellow one. Popping each color and taking out the enemies at different colors give 
different points.

Enemies also change color.

flying -> popped -> inflates -> changes color -> flying

| Color  | Popped | Beaten in the air | Beaten on-ground |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Pink   |   500  |        1000       |        750       |
| Green  |   750  |        1500       |       1000       |
| Yellow |  1000  |        2000       |       1500       |

--------------------

- Fish seems to appear randomly when there's someone below.
- The player doesn't maintain the acceleration after the button is released.
- A: one flap. B: constant flap.
- The player doesn't move when left or right is pressed in the air, unless he's flapping.
- The player has three sets of two balloons.
- Clouds emit sparks after some time. There are no more than two at the same time, and they disappear 
after a while.
- Sparks bounce off the top and off the platforms.
- Hitting a spark pops both balloons.
- Every time an enemy is beaten, either by breaking their parachute, or by kicking them off the ground, a bubble rises out of the water. It gives 500 points
