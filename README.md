# Balloon Battle
A work-in-progress Java recreation of the 1984 game Balloon Fight, originally developed by Satoru Iwata. This is meant as a tribute.

Take a look at the [Releases](https://github.com/MarianoAlipi/balloon-fight/releases) page to see different working versions of the game.

Contributions are welcome!
